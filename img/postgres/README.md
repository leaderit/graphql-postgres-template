# postgis/postgis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/postgis/docker-postgis.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/postgis/docker-postgis) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/postgis/docker-postgis](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/postgis/docker-postgis?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The `postgis/postgis` image provides tags for running Postgres with [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) extensions installed. This image is based on the official [`postgres`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) image and provides debian and alpine variants for PostGIS both 2.5.x and 3.0.x for each supported version of Postgres (9.5, 9.6, 10, 11, and 12).  Additionally, an image version is provided which is built from the latest version of Postgres (12) with versions of PostGIS and its dependencies built from their respective master branches.

This image ensures that the default database created by the parent `postgres` image will have the following extensions installed:

* `postgis`
* `postgis_topology`
* `fuzzystrmatch`
* `postgis_tiger_geocoder`

Unless `-e POSTGRES_DB` is passed to the container at startup time, this database will be named after the admin user (either `postgres` or the user specified with `-e POSTGRES_USER`). If you would prefer to use the older template database mechanism for enabling PostGIS, the image also provides a PostGIS-enabled template database called `template_postgis`.

## Usage

In order to run a basic container capable of serving a PostGIS-enabled database, start a container as follows:

    docker run --name some-postgis -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgis/postgis

For more detailed instructions about how to start and control your Postgres container, see the documentation for the `postgres` image [here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/).

Once you have started a database container, you can then connect to the database as follows:

    docker run -it --link some-postgis:postgres --rm postgres \
        sh -c 'exec psql -h "$POSTGRES_PORT_5432_TCP_ADDR" -p "$POSTGRES_PORT_5432_TCP_PORT" -U postgres'

See [the PostGIS documentation](http://postgis.net/docs/postgis_installation.html#create_new_db_extensions) for more details on your options for creating and using a spatially-enabled database.

## Known Issues / Errors

When You encouter errors due to PostGIS update `OperationalError: could not access file "$libdir/postgis-X.X`, run:

`docker exec some-postgis update-postgis.sh`

It will update to Your newest PostGIS. Update is idempotent, so it won't hurt when You run it more than once, You will get notification like:
